# Fun with Profunctors in PureScript
Use case examples of ProFunctors that I found from Haskell and ported to PureScript. 

## Quick Start
Ensure you have installed the lastest versions of rimraf, Psc-package, Pulp, PureScript (^0.12).  Then:

$ npm run all

Then, run `$ npm run exec` afterwards.  There's also Bower support if you so like.  Enjoy!
